# 🧠 Memory Game

## 📌 Project Overview

**Memory Game** is an interactive web-based game where players match pairs of images by flipping cards. The goal is to complete the game in the fewest number of attempts possible while tracking the player's score.

This project was developed as a **college group project**, with multiple contributors working on different sections of the code. Since all JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code is contained within single shared files, my specific contributions are integrated within the overall development of the game.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Play

1️⃣ Open `index.html` in a web browser.

2️⃣ Click on two cards to flip them over.

3️⃣ If they match, they remain flipped; if not, they turn back.

4️⃣ **Wait for the validation process** before selecting a new pair.

5️⃣ Continue until all pairs are matched.

6️⃣ The game tracks your **attempts** and **high score**.
